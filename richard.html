                  <h2>Introduction</h2>
                  <p>
                     Hi my name is Richard and i'm originally from the Netherlands, I am half Dutch and half Thai. I'm a student at Windesheim University in Zwolle and my major is Business IT. In my free time, i enjoy diving, chess and playing piano
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I love to travel and speak different languages, I have lived in over 4 different countries, now 5 being of course Japan. One of my goals is to become a dive master and get my masters in business administration.

                  <h2>More about me</h2>
                  <h3 class="richard-color">Which countries I've lived in</h3>
                  <p>
                     I was born in Rotterdam but I have never lived there before, due to my dad's profession we moved to Lagos, Nigera. 
                     After 3 years we moved to Kuala Lumper Malaysia where I learned english at a british school and a few years later we moved to Jakarta in Indonesia. 
                     Eventually we moved back to the Netherlands back in 2012.
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="richard-color">What are my hobbies?</h3>
                  <p>
                     My biggest hobby is diving, I absolutely love diving and the feeling of being able to breathe underwater. Currently I am a certified Rescue Diver and plan on being a Master Diver next year. After that I might become a Dive Instructor in Thailand for a while. <br>
                     Besides diving I love playing chess online and playing piano. I have been playing piano for over 10 years now and I have been playing chess for about 5 years now.
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="richard-color">What am I currently working on?</h3>
                  <p>
                     Currently I am trying to make a social network for a exchange students community back in Europe called "Erasmus Student Network" or "ESN" in short
