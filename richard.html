        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I'm originally from the Netherlands and I'm half Dutch and half Thai. I'm a student at Windesheim University back in Zwolle studying Business IT. In my free time, I enjoy diving and playing piano</p>
        <p>I love to travel and speak different languages, I have lived in over 4 different countries, now 5 being of course Japan. One of my goals is to become a dive master and get my masters in business administration.</p>

        <h2>More about me</h2>
        <h3>Where am I from?</h3>
        <p>I was born in Rotterdam but due to my dad's profession we moved to Nigera. 
            After 3 years we moved to Kuala Lumper Malaysia where i learned english at a british school and a few years later we moved to Jakarta in Indonesia. 
            Eventually we moved back to the Netherlands back in 2012.</p>

        <h3>What is my hobby?</h3>
        <p>My biggest hobby is diving, I absolutely love diving and the feeling of being able to breathe underwater. Currently I am a certified Rescue Diver and plan on being a Master Diver next year. After that I might become a Dive Instructor in Thailand for a while. </p>

        <h3>What am I currently working on?</h3>
        <p>So currently I am trying to make a social network for a exchange students community back in Europe called "Erasmus Student Network" or "ESN" in short</p>
