            Hello, my name is Tuan Manh Nguyen. I am originally from Vietnam, but I am currently studying in Japan 
            as part of an exchange program. I love to travel and take photos of my adventures. Before coming to Japan, 
            I studied in Italy and developed a deep appreciation for its culture and history.
